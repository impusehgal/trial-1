    <p> In 2021, the projected number of food insecure New Yorkers was approximately 1.4 million, half the population of Nevada. A majority of these people are residents of South Bronx where many non-profits operate to curb the issue. The major front-runner, Mott Haven Fridge Network, has been serving the South Bronx community ever since the pandemic hit the country. With their pop-up pantries and community fridges, they've helped provide food to many starving families in the borough. At a recent fund raising brunch organized by Arc'teryx in Manhattan, owner Daniel Zauderer has announced his decision to take the non-profit to new heights. The organization is being rebranded as Grassroots Grocery and will now serve food insecure hubs all around NYC. To celebrate the expansion of our homegrown organization, lets hark back to what it's done for our Borough of Bronx. </p>

       <p> Sourcing food: In most cases of food insecurity, lack of nutritious food is the significant reason as to why the community is starving. However, Bronx happens to be the home to Hunts Point Market (the biggest food market in United States! ) and a plethora of lucrative businesses that deal with food in one way or another, and often times the excess produce just ends up getting wasted because many people living in the area can't afford to buy it. Grassroots Grocery salvages the fresh and unsold produce from Hunts Point to feed hundreds of residents across the city. They have sourced 10,000 pounds of produce until now. </p>

   <p> Volunteer work: There is no denying that transportation is expensive and an average resident's lack of accessability to these resources is what aggravates the problem. So, every Saturday, dozens of volunteers from Grassroots Grocery load up their cars in the parking lot with fruits and vegetables. Then they fan out and deliver the food to 30 different neighbourhoods across the city. </p>

   <p> Four community fridges and numerous pantries: At the fundraising brunch, Grassroots Grocery, along with their partner Gotham Food Pantry, christened a new community fridge that will be installed near the Fredrick Douglass Houses on the Upper West Side. This fridge marks their first expansion outside of the Bronx area. Previously Grassroots Grocery has opened up three more community fridges in the Bronx-- two in the Mott Haven neighbourhood and one in Co-Op city. They also trasnport food to other hub areas owned by Gotham Food Pantry and similar organizations around the city. </p>

   <p> Promoting the Brand: To reflect the organization’s growth beyond its humble beginnings in the South Bronx, Dan Zauderer decided to update their name to Grassroots Grocery. He said he feels the universal connotation better captures the work he and his volunteers are doing. His ultimate hope is that the rebrand will give a sense that they are part of a larger movement. Zauderer said the rebrand effort is ongoing, with a <a href="https://www.grassrootsgrocery.org"> new website </a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/grassrootsgroceryny/?hl=en"> updated social media handles</a> serving as visible signs of progress. The organization also caught the attention of Kelly Clarkson, who invited Daniel Zauderer on her show. Check out the video here.</p>
